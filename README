I don't really know what I'm doing, so forgive me in advance.

I am currently learning C# and to put my knowledge into practice I decided to write a text RPG.

You know, like you usually do when writing console apps.

So yeah, this is my code for my in-console text RPG. There's a lot (and I mean A LOT) of messy code 
or stuff that works on some sort of noob magic.

What else do I write here?
